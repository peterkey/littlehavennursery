# Enquiry Link Tracking Implementation

This document shows how to implement tracking for "Enquire Now" links so you can know which service users are interested in.

## How It Works

1. **URL Parameters**: Add service information to contact form URLs
2. **Auto-fill Form**: Contact form automatically pre-fills with service details
3. **Enhanced Data**: Form submission includes service, location, and source information
4. **Better Insights**: You'll know exactly what users are enquiring about
